# DungeonBreaker

## CodeBreaker is a web based game following the rules of master mind.
    
You click the buttons at the bottom of the page to build a guess code, then click the submit button to check if you guessed the hidden code generated by the computer 

If you guessed the code correctly a pop up shows up saying that you guessed the correct code.

if part of the code was correct the guess will be loaded onto the board and green and yellow indicators next to the guess will light up.

For each green indicator that means there is a correct item in a correct position.

for each yellow indiciator, that means there is a correct item in an incorrect position.

    Note: the position of the green or yellow indicator does not corrilate to the the position item itself.

You have 10 tries to guess the secret code, it you do not then you lose.
